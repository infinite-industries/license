# Limited License Agreement

http://infinite.industries/license/limited_license_agreement/

This license is designed for digital art content distribution, a part of core activities of Infinite Industries. It is available through this repo in multiple formats (html, markdown, docx, html) in order to provide a template for similar activities and promote the conversation around art content distribution in contemporary economy.   

Special thanks to [Kentucky Lawyers](http://www.kylawyersforthearts.org/) for the Arts for their work on creating this license document.

Roadmap of future changes:
1. Adopt a versioning scheme
2. Create "human-readable" version of the document
3. Integrate "human-readable version" with the html version of the license hosted through this repo  

This is a living document. Please feel free to propose changes via email [info@infinite.industries](mailto:info@infinite.industries), issues or formal pull request.
